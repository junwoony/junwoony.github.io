<a href="" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer"></a>


I am a <a href="https://www.cheme.engineering.cmu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Chemical Engineering</a> PhD student, advised by <a href="https://ulissigroup.cheme.cmu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Zachary Ulissi</a> and concurrently pursuing a MS in <a href="https://www.ml.cmu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Machine Learning</a> at <a href="https://www.cmu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Carnegie Mellon University (CMU)</a>.

I am broadly interested in developing deep learning methods for solving real-world problems related to materials design, climate change, and other engineering domains. 
My research focuses on studying how to incorporate chemistry domain knowledge into various deep learning models to improve predictability and generalizability. 
I work closely with collaborators at <a href="https://ai.facebook.com/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Facebook AI Research (FAIR)</a>, and other <a href="https://sites.google.com/view/barati" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">AI</a> and <a href="http://uhv.cheme.cmu.edu/" target="_blank" rel="noopener noreferrer">Experimental</a> groups at CMU to deploy deep learning algorithms to accelerate existing workflows and the discovery of novel inorganic materials.
